In 1920, Sir Eddington thought about the energy source of the sun: "A star is drawing on same vast reservoir of energy [...] we sometimes dream than man will one day learn how to release it and use for his service." 

Can be considered as fusion research kick-off.

For a single proton in the sun to fuse together with another proton, it takes approximately 10^9 years. Yes, that is 1000000000 years and, yes, that is very long. That is why we prefer the Deuterium - Tritium fusion on earth.

In the D+T fusion reaction, only 20 % of the released energy is stored in the He nucleus (the neutron takes the remaining 80 %). Thus, only 20 % of the released energy can be used for further plasma heating. This is why good confinement is vital for a reactor.

Neutral beam injection for ITER requires particle energies above 1 MeV. Negative ion sources have to be used at these energies as neutralization of positive hydrogen ions is very inefficient. SPIDER is a prototype for ITER's ion source, located in Padova (Italy).

DEMO, the prototype for a commercial fusion power plant, will most likely be a tokamak. With the recent success of the W7-X, however, the stellarator is still an option. A decision will be made in the early 2030s, after ITER's first relevant results are in.

Impurities in a fusion plasma (created via plasma-wall interactions) lead to strong losses via bremsstrahlung radiation. A major breakthrough was the divertor concept where plasma flow is directed to regions far away thus reducing the influence of impurities.

Applying enough heating to a plasma in a tokamak or stellarator, it can transit to a state of higher energy confinement, the H-mode. Discovered in 1982, reproduced on numerous devices, it is still not fully understood, transition cannot be reproduced in simulations.

The energy release in fusion, e.g. in the sun, is based on the fact that a helium nucleus weighs less than its 4 constituents weighted separately. This mass defect was discovered 100 years ago and is explained by the binding energy holding the nucleus together.

A fusion plasma, consisting of charged particles, emits a lot of electromagnetic radiation. Only the boundary of the plasma is cold enough such that the radiation is in the visible range, the rest are X-rays which explains why the plasma appears to be invisible.

The confinement of tokamak plasmas improves when increasing the isotope mass of the gas forming the plasma. The improvement is due to a change in the turbulent dynamics of the plasmas, but a complete understanding of this isotope effect is still lacking.

If the plasma density in a tokamak exceeds a threshold, the plasma becomes unstable, the confinement is lost. The limit is called Greenwald density, it depends on magnetic field & tokamak size. It does not exists in stellarators, the reason is not fully understood.
